### Hey! 👋

I'm Software Engineer with over 4 years experience in creating solutions based on C++ and Python.
I'm huge enthusiast of learning new things, but lately, my attention is mostly focused on:
* ⚡ getting more and more familiar with most popular C++ libraries/frameworks, like Boost or Qt
* ⚙️ keeping up with latest innovations in C++ language
* 🖥️ frontend development with Qt & QML
* 🎓 machine learning with Python
* 🌱 learning basics of Rust

Apart from working full-time, I'm trying to finish my MSc 🎓 in field strongly related to usage of machine learning in medicine 🩻.

Feel free to follow me anywhere 😺
